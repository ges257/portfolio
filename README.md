## Code Projects

- [Sleep Trouble and BMI in Adults Over 30: Testing the Moderating Role of Physical Activity](code/sleep-bmi-analysis)  
  Logistic regression on NHANES data to explore how physical activity moderates the link between BMI and sleep trouble.

- [Gregory vs ChatGPT Image Denoising Challenge](code/gregory-vs-chatgpt-image-denoising-challenge)  
  Compare a custom image-denoising pipeline against ChatGPT’s static PDF outputs and visualize before/after results.

- [Forward–Inverse Kinematics](code/forward-inverse-kinematics)  
  Implement fixed-point, bisection, and Newton methods to solve forward and inverse kinematics problems numerically.

- [GPS Positioning](code/gps-positioning)  
  Newton-method solver for GPS receiver position and clock bias plus conditioning analysis via ±1×10⁻⁸ s travel-time perturbations.

- [SVD Image Compression](code/svd-image-compression)  
  Manual SVD on each RGB channel to compress an image, quantify reconstruction error, and measure memory savings.

- [Molecular Conformation Numerical Optimization](code/molecular-conformation-numerical-optimization)  
  Optimize a molecule’s atomic coordinates using gradient-based numerical methods to minimize potential energy.
